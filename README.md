## Building

These following tools are required to build the GRF:

- nmlc
- python

Using `bash` is suggested, but powershell also works.

*Note: `git on Windows` provides a `bash` environment.*

This GRF could be built on multiple platforms; however, if you are on Windows, please change the end of line sequence from `CRLF` to `LF`. You could only change `JPPlusTrams.nml` without changing the other files, and it would still work.
